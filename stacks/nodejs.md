## Node.js stack

The following is our stack for Node.js projects. Remember to use [our generator](https://github.com/nover/generator-node-es6).

 - [Hapi.js](https://hapijs.com/) as the web framework

    Provides a lot of functionality out-of-the-box, which means more time to write the actual code for the project.

 - [Mocha](mochajs.org) as the test framework

    Has great tool support, is mature and has a big following.

 - [Unexpected](unexpected.js.org) for assertions

    Great documentation and even greater error messages. We also have a direct line to the developers.
 
 - [TestDouble](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js) for mocking

    After much trial-and-error with different mocking frameworks, this turned out to be the best one. It replaces terms from computer science with actual words and matches our own philosophy (most of the time).

 - [Eslint](eslint.org) for linting

    Great tool support and lots of options.
