## .Net stack

The following is our stack for projects that run on .Net.

 - [.Net Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) as the base framework and runtime

    Excellent project from the big bad wolf, where they are finally doing the open source thing correctly.

 - [ServiceStack](https://servicestack.net/) as the web framework

    Great message based web framework with lots of additional tools and focus on performance.

 - [xUnit](http://xunit.github.io/) as the test framework

    They have got laptop stickers! Nuff said...

 - [FakeItEasy](https://fakeiteasy.github.io/) for mocking

    Provides one of the more sane mock APIs for .NET.

 - IoC Container ???
