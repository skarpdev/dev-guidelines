## Skarp developer guidelines

These pages contain the developer guidelines that we use every day. They cover everything from nomenclature to code style, how to test and examples of useful patterns.

The guidelines will be continously updated as we learn new things and the world changes, so keep checking in.

If you like what you see and you are interested in hiring us (or for us to hire you) visit [skarp.dk](https://skarp.dk) and contact us :)
